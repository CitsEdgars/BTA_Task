# BTA_Task
Java program that receives in input a text file with characters and calculates letter frequency of all Latin alphabet letters. Then, it outputs the distribution in output.txt file.

Program accepts file name with extension in variables. They need to be defined either in IDE when launching or by compiling the project in the folder and then excecuting 
through command line like this - "java Dictionary example_1.txt". Since the working directory in IDE is considered the whole project folder, the latter approach requires 
"src/main/resources/" and "src/main/results/" folders to be created. Input files need to be moved to the resources folder and an output report will be generated in results folder.

Automated test cases check the functionality of some of the functions contained in Dictionary.java.
